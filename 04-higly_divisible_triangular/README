The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. 
So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. 
The first ten terms would be:
                              1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

 1: 1
 3: 1,3
 6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

Write a function that receives a natural number N as input at that gives
the smallest triangular number to have N divisors.

You may want to refer to prime numbers table, tough there exists a solution
that does not use it. Such solution may be slower but surely is more challenging
