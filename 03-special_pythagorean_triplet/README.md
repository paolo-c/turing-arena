A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which
	a^2+b^2=c^2
For example 3^2+4^2=9+16=25=5^2

Given a natural number N, find a Pythagorean triplet (a,b,c) 
such that  a+b+c=N.

Beware that such triplet may not exist, in that case the output shall be
the triplet (-1,-1,-1) 
Also the output (a,b,c) should respect the relation a<b<c
