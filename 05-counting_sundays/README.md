You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

	1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.

	Thirty days has September,
	April, June and November.
	All the rest have thirty-one,
	Saving February alone,
	Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
	And on leap years, twenty-nine.

	A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, 
	but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
	
	
Write a function that receives 3 natural numbers as input (d,m,y) and gives as 
output the number of days from 01/01/1900 to the day d/m/y.

Also write a function that receive the same input and tells 
how many Sundays fell on the first of the month from 01/01/1900 to d/m/y

HINT: You may want to write a function isleap(y) that tells you wheter an year
is leap or not
