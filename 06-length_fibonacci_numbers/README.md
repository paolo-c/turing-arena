The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
         F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}, where F_1 = 1 and F_2 = 1.

Hence the first 12 terms will be:
* F_1  = 1
* F_2  = 1
* F_3  = 2
* F_4  = 3
* F_5  = 5
* F_6  = 8
* F_7  = 13
* F_8  = 21
* F_9  = 34
* F_10 = 55
* F_11 = 89
* F_12 = 144

The 12th term, F_12, is the first term to contain three digits.

Write a function that, given a natural number N, tells the index of the first
