For a given natural number N, consider the series:
S_N = 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + 4^4 + ... + N^N

For example for N=10: S_N=10405071317

Write a function that receive N as input and gives the last 10 digits of S_N.

If the first digits are zero, they shall be ommised. 
For instance for N=10, the output must be 405071317 

HINT: When the numbers get big, it is necessary to store only the last digits 
      of the numbers
