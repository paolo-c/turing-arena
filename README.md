# Selection of problems for Turing Arena.
The problems are presented in an order that I consider from the easiest to the most difficult.
If you are not familiar with Turing Arena, I strongly suggest to start with the first one.
However if you are stocked into a problem, feel free to skip it!

Every problem has its own directory which always contains a file README.md, 
such file describes the problem and sometimes hints.
Most of problems are taken from https://projecteuler.net/ and adapted to fit Turing Arena project.
The link to the original problem is always provided in the readme file.

If you find any issue, or you have any suggestion, please contact me at comensoli.paolo@gmail.com
