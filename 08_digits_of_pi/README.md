Computing the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle is 
a problem as old as the first civilization of the mankind.
In the 19th century BC, Babylonian mathematicians computed that Pi 
can be approximated to 25/8, about 0.5 percent below the exact value. 
Almost two thousands years later, in the 3rd century BC, 
Archimedes computed that 223/71<Pi<22/7, achieving an accuracy of 0.02 percent. 
Nowadays,in 2016, 22.4 trillion digits of Pi were computed.

Your goal is to compute as many digits of Pi as you can. 
You get a point for each correct digits of Pi; 
for instance Babylonians get 2 as score, while Archimedes gets 3.
How far can you go?

Hint: Every language has a limited precision for float numbers.
For instance with python if you use pure float numbers, you cannot get any better 
than 16; if you want to go beyond, you need to be creative.
